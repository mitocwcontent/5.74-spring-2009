There are no required books for the class, but you will need to read on the lecture topics in some of the following references. [Specific readings](#Suggested_Readings) are suggested in the table below, where the texts are referred to by number.

Texts You Can't Do Without
--------------------------

\[Nitzan\] = Nitzan, Abraham. _Chemical Dynamics in Condensed Phases_. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2006. ISBN: 9780198529798.  
This is a wonderful new book that thoroughly covers all topics that you might care to learn about for time-dependent quantum mechanics relevant to the condensed phase. We will follow the treatment of several topics in this book.

\[Schatz\] = Schatz, George C., and Mark A. Ratner. _Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry_. Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, 2002. ISBN: 9780486420035.  
This is an important book to have. It has the most overlap with the topics we will cover, uses a similar language and notation, and treats the problems at a similar level.

Additional References
---------------------

These are excellent readings for the lecture topics, and problems are often drawn from them.

\[McHale\] = McHale, J. L. _Molecular Spectroscopy_. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1998. ISBN: 9780132290630.  
This text covers basic light matter interactions, correlation functions, and various molecular spectroscopies.

\[Merzbacher\] = Merzbacher, E. _Quantum Mechanics_. 3rd ed. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 1997. ISBN: 9780471887027.  
General physics text for quantum dynamics, perturbation theory, light-matter interactions.

\[Mukamel\] = Mukamel, S. _Principles of Nonlinear Optical Spectroscopy_. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1999. ISBN: 9780195132915.  
This is an advanced text that treats quantum dynamics, correlation functions, response functions, coupling of a system to a bath, and nonlinear spectroscopy.

\[Sakurai\] = Sakurai, J. J. _Modern Quantum Mechanics_. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1993. ISBN: 9780201539295.

\[Tannor\] = Tannor, D. J. _Introduction to Quantum Mechanics: A Time-Dependent Perspective_. Sausilito, CA: University Science Books, 2006. ISBN: 9781891389238.  
This appears to be a wonderful new quantum textbook at the level of this class. It was just published, so I haven't had time to digest it yet, but it clearly will be an excellent reference.
